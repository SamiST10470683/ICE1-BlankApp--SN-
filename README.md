# ICE 1: Blank App Setup - [SN]

## My Experience During Setup

My goal for this task was to set up a complete Visual Studio Code development environment and launch the initial application. I began by configuring a virtual machine (VM) and successfully set up the project, even beginning to edit the code in **Visual Studio Code**.

Unfortunately, just as I was finalising the code, I ran into a critical technical roadblock. The virtual machine I was relying on for development crashed and became completely unresponsive. This blocked me from accessing the project files or using the command-line tools to run the app.

Despite my best efforts to troubleshoot and repair the VM, I was unable to get it running again before the submission deadline. As a result, I could not complete the final step of launching the app or pushing the completed source code to this repository. I have contacted my lecturer to explain the situation in more detail.

## Setup Steps I Followed

These are the steps I successfully completed before my environment failed:

1.  **Environment Preparation:** I Reimaged and launched a new virtual machine for the project.
2.  **Dependency Installation:** I installed the required versions of Node.js and npm inside the VM.
3.  **Project Creation:** I successfully created the initial project structure using `npx create-expo-app`.
4.  **Code Editing:** I opened the project folder in **Visual Studio Code** within the VM and began editing the `App.js` file.

It was during this final editing stage that the environment failed, preventing me from saving the final changes or running the application.
